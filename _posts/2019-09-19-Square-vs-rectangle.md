title: Square vs Rectangle 
---

Qu

Why is a rectangle and a square a bad example of an inheritance?
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires **all** the properties and behaviors of a parent object.


I believe that this relationship would be on the sibling side, because they are both shapes. 
So the parent here would be "shapes" and the children would be square, rectangle,  ect.
