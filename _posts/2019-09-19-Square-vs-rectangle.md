title: Square vs Rectangle 
---

Why is a rectangle and a square a bad example of an inheritance?  

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires **all** the properties and **behaviors** of a parent object. 

Although a square is considered a rectangle, a square has different behaviors than a rectangle. 
If you were to change the height of Rectangle, width would not be affected.  

With square, on the other hand, you would have to change both length and width.  
Since square does not have **all** the behaviors from the "parent rectangle" ,  
we can conclude that rectangle...." You are NOT the father!".
