title: GRASP 101

## What does GRASP do?  
GRASP helps us decide which responsibility should be assigned to which object or class, defining the blue prints for those objects. 

## GRASP Principles:
1. Creator - Factory, Builder, Object Mother -- what creates the object
1. Information Expert - Single Responsiblitly principle, who has responsibility of what
1. Low Coupling - dependent, used in one place, minimize dependency on other classes
1. High Cohesion - all working to accomplish same goal, not one time use
1. Controller - delagates the work and coordinates
1. Indirection - avoids a direct coupling between two or more elements
1. Polymorphism - many different implementations that respond the same, helps decide which object is responsible for handling diff elements.
1. Protected Variations - immutablity, avoid conditions on types to let polymorphism do its thing, protect the way objects change in its controlled space
1. Pure Fabrication - creating something out of the blue
