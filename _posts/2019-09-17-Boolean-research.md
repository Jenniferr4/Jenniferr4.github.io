title: Boolean Research

According to my online research, 
I found that there are six logical, 
or boolean, operators. 
They are:
* AND ( & ) Returns true if both of the operands
evaluate to true. Both operands are
evaluated before the And operator is applied.

* conditional AND ( && ) Same as &, but if the operand on
the left returns false, it returns false without evaluating the operand on the
right.

* OR ( | ) Returns true if at least one of the
operands evaluates to true. Both operands
are evaluated before the Or operator is applied.

* conditional OR ( || ) Same as |, but if the operand on the
left returns true, it returns true without evaluating the operand on the
right.

* exclusive OR ( ^ ) Returns true if one — and only
one — of the operands evaluates to true. Returns false
if both operands evaluate to true or if
both operands evaluate to false.

* NOT ( ! ) Returns true if the operand to the
right evaluates to false. Returns false if the operand to the right is true.

## Truth Table
 
The truth table shows all possible combinations of the 
variables showing the relation between the values that 
variables may take and the result of the operation.
